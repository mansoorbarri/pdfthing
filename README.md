</h1>

Welcome to **pdfthing**! 🎉

Ever felt frustrated with PDF tools that don't quite cut it? Well, I did too! That's why I built **pdfthing** – a simple, no-nonsense PDF utility designed to get the job done. It may not do everything right now, but what it *does* do, it does well. 🙌

Currently, **pdfthing** supports:
- **Splitting PDFs** 📄➡️📄
- **Compressing PDFs** (goodbye, oversized files!) 📉

These features are what I need right now, but stay tuned! More tools might come as I continue working on the site.

## Why pdfthing? 🤔

Because the other PDF tools out there were either too complicated, too slow, or just plain awful. I built this for people who want straightforward, fast, and reliable PDF utilities. No ads, no fuss, just PDF tools that work.

## Features 🎯

### Split PDFs
- Upload your PDF and split it into smaller files.
- Extract specific pages or sections that you need.

### Compress PDFs
- Upload large PDFs and shrink them down to a manageable size without sacrificing quality.
